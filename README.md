- **_IDE_** stands for Integrated Development Environment.
- An Environment to wirte, run, compile and debug the code.

We need a `compiler` and need to install [**_JDK_**(_Java Development Kit_)](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download/?sc_cid=701f2000000RWTnAAO).

# Check Java Installation

```bash
java --version

javac --version
```

## Introduction

### File Extension

- java files work with `.java` extentsion

### Compile

- `javac` is used to compile the java file.

### Run

- `java` is used to run the compiled file.

### Example

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java

java HelloWorld
```

### Note

- `javac` and `java` commands are used to compile and run the java files.

## JShell

- JShell is a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) tool.

- It is used to test the java code without creating a file.

- It is used to test the code line by line.

- `jshell` command is used to start the JShell.

```bash
jshell
```

- It will start the JShell.

- We can write the code and test it.

- We can also use the `jshell` to test the code and then write it to the file.

### JSHELL Example

```java
jshell> System.out.println("Hello World")
Hello World
```

# JAVA Basics

## JVM

- In our machine we have **_JVM_**(_*Java Virtual Machine*_).
- It makes the **_JAVA_** plateform independent.
- We can run our **_JAVA_** application only due to the **_JVM_**.
- But **_JVM_** is plateform dependent.
- It only understands byte codes.
- It runs our **_JAVA_** application which is in the byte code.
- A developer writes the program in `JAVA code` which is converted into `Byte code` by the **_`JAVAC`_**(_*JAVA Compiler*_).
- **_JVM_** starts the execution from the first file which must have the `main()` method.

```java
public void main() // it will take some arguements
```

- `javac hello.java` will output a `hello.class` file which is a byte code

- The file extentsion for byte code is `.class`.

## Note

- To run the byte code use `java hello`.
- If we include the file extension it will not run and throw an error.

## JRE

- **_JRE_** stands for **_Java Runtime Environment_**.
- It is used to run the **_JAVA_** application.
- It contains the **_JVM_** and other libraries.

## JDK

- **_JDK_** stands for **_Java Development Kit_**.
- It is used to develop the **_JAVA_** application.
- It contains the **_JRE_** and other development tools.
- It contains the **_JVM_** and other libraries.
- It contains the **_JAVAC_** and other development tools.

## variables

- A variable is a container which holds the value.
- It is a name given to the memory location.
- It is used to store the data.
- It is used to store the data so that we can use it later.
- Variables in **_JAVA_** are strongly typed.
- We need to declare the type of the variable before using it.

### Example

```java
int a = 10;
```

## Data Types

- **_Data Types_** are used to define the type of the variable.
- It is used to define the type of the data that the variable can store.
- **_JAVA_** is a strongly typed language.
- We need to define the type of the variable before using it.
- **_JAVA_** has two types of data types:
  - **_Primitive Data Types_**
  - **_Non-Primitive Data Types_**

### Primitive Data Types

- **_Primitive Data Types_** are the basic data types.
- They are used to store the simple values.
- They are used to store the values directly.
- They are used to store the values in the memory.
- **_Primitive Data Types_** are:
  - **_Integer_** - stores the integer values.
    - **byte** - 1 byte - range -128 to 127
    - **short** - 2 bytes - range -32,768 to 32,767
    - **int** - 4 bytes - range -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
    - **long** - 8 bytes - range -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  - **_Floating Point_** - stores the floating point values.
    - **float** - 4 bytes - range 3.4e-038 to 3.4e+038
    - **double** - 8 bytes - range 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308 â€“ default float in JAVA
  - **_Character_** - stores the character values.
    - **char** - 2 bytes - range 0 to 65,536
  - **_Boolean_** - stores the boolean values.
    - **bool** - 1 bit - range true or false
