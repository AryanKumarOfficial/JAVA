- **_IDE_** stands for Integrated Development Environment.
- An Environment to wirte, run, compile and debug the code.

We need a `compiler` and need to install [**_JDK_**(_Java Development Kit_)](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download/?sc_cid=701f2000000RWTnAAO).

# Check Java Installation

```bash
java --version

javac --version
```

## Introduction

### File Extension

- java files work with `.java` extentsion

### Compile

- `javac` is used to compile the java file.

### Run

- `java` is used to run the compiled file.

### Example

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java

java HelloWorld
```

### Note

- `javac` and `java` commands are used to compile and run the java files.

## JShell

- JShell is a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) tool.

- It is used to test the java code without creating a file.

- It is used to test the code line by line.

- `jshell` command is used to start the JShell.

```bash
jshell
```

- It will start the JShell.

- We can write the code and test it.

- We can also use the `jshell` to test the code and then write it to the file.

### JSHELL Example

```java
jshell> System.out.println("Hello World")
Hello World
```

# JAVA Basics

## JVM

- In our machine we have **_JVM_**(_*Java Virtual Machine*_).
- It makes the **_JAVA_** plateform independent.
- We can run our **_JAVA_** application only due to the **_JVM_**.
- But **_JVM_** is plateform dependent.
- It only understands byte codes.
- It runs our **_JAVA_** application which is in the byte code.
- A developer writes the program in `JAVA code` which is converted into `Byte code` by the **_`JAVAC`_**(_*JAVA Compiler*_).
- **_JVM_** starts the execution from the first file which must have the `main()` method.

```java
public void main() // it will take some arguements
```

- `javac hello.java` will output a `hello.class` file which is a byte code

- The file extentsion for byte code is `.class`.

## Note

- To run the byte code use `java hello`.
- If we include the file extension it will not run and throw an error.

## JRE

- **_JRE_** stands for **_Java Runtime Environment_**.
- It is used to run the **_JAVA_** application.
- It contains the **_JVM_** and other libraries.

## JDK

- **_JDK_** stands for **_Java Development Kit_**.
- It is used to develop the **_JAVA_** application.
- It contains the **_JRE_** and other development tools.
- It contains the **_JVM_** and other libraries.
- It contains the **_JAVAC_** and other development tools.

## variables

- A variable is a container which holds the value.
- It is a name given to the memory location.
- It is used to store the data.
- It is used to store the data so that we can use it later.
- Variables in **_JAVA_** are strongly typed.
- We need to declare the type of the variable before using it.

### Example

```java
int a = 10;
```

## Data Types

- **_Data Types_** are used to define the type of the variable.

# JAVA OOPs Concepts

- **_OOPs_** stands for **_Object-Oriented Programming_**.

- **_OOPs_** is a programming paradigm.

- **_OOPs_** is used to design the program using the objects.

- **_OOPs_** has the following concepts:
  - **_Class_**
  - **_Object_**
  - **_Inheritance_**
  - **_Polymorphism_**
  - **_Abstraction_**
  - **_Encapsulation_**

## Class

- **_Class_** is a blueprint of the object.

- **_Class_** is used to create the object.

- **_Class_** is used to define the properties and behaviors of the object.

- **_Class_** is used to define the methods and variables.

### Example

```java
class Student
{
    int id;
    String name;
    void display()
    {
        System.out.println(id+" "+name);
    }
}
```

## Object

- **_Object_** is an instance of the class.

- **_Object_** is used to create the instance of the class.

- **_Object_** is used to access the properties and behaviors of the class.

- **_Object_** is used to access the methods and variables.

### Example

```java
Student s1 = new Student();
s1.id = 101;
s1.name = "John";
s1.display();
```

## Inheritance

- **_Inheritance_** is used to inherit the properties and behaviors of the class.

- **_Inheritance_** is used to create the new class from the existing class.

- **_Inheritance_** is used to reuse the code.

- **_Inheritance_** is used to create the parent-child relationship.

### Example

```java
class Animal
{
    void eat()
    {
        System.out.println("eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends
Animal
{
    void bark()
    {
        System.out.println("barking...");
    }
}
```

## Polymorphism

- **_Polymorphism_** is used to perform the multiple operations.

- **_Polymorphism_** is used to perform the single operation in different ways.

- **_Polymorphism_** is used to perform the method overloading and method overriding.

### Method Overloading

- **_Method Overloading_** is used to create the multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

- **_Method Overloading_** is used to perform the same operation in different ways.

### Example

```java

class Add
{
    int add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a+b;
    }

    {
        return a+b+c;
    }
}
```

### Method Overriding

- **_Method Overriding_** is used to create the method in the child class with the same name and same parameters as the parent class.

### Example

```java

class Animal
{
    void eat()
    {
        System.out.println("eating...");
    }
}

Animal
{
    void eat()
    {
        System.out.println("barking...");
    }
}
```

## Abstraction

- **_Abstraction_** is used to hide the internal details and show only the necessary details.

- **_Abstraction_** is used to create the abstract class and abstract methods.

### Example

```java

abstract class Animal
{
    abstract void eat();
}

class Dog extends

Animal
{
    void eat()
    {
        System.out.println("eating...");
    }
}
```

## Encapsulation

- **_Encapsulation_** is used to bind the data and methods into a single unit.

- **_Encapsulation_** is used to create the class with the private variables and public methods.

- **_Encapsulation_** is used to hide the data from the outside world.

### Example

```java

class Student
{
    private int id;
    private String name;
    public void setId(int id)
    {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public int getId()
    {
        return id;
    }
    public void setName(String name)

# Arrays

- **_Arrays_** are used to store the multiple values in a single variable.

- **_Arrays_** are used to store the collection of similar type of elements.

- **_Arrays_** are used to store the collection of elements of the same data type.

- **_JAVA_** has the following types of **_Arrays_**:
  - **_Single Dimensional Array_**
  - **_Multi Dimensional Array_**

## Single Dimensional Array

- **_Single Dimensional Array_** is used to store the collection of elements of the same data type.

- **_Single Dimensional Array_** is used to store the collection of elements in a single row.

- **_Single Dimensional Array_** is used to store the collection of elements in a single column.

### Example

```java
int a[] = new int[5];
a[0] = 10;
a[1] = 20;
a[2] = 30;
a[3] = 40;
a[4] = 50;
```

## Multi Dimensional Array

- **_Multi Dimensional Array_** is used to store the collection of elements of the same data type.

- **_Multi Dimensional Array_** is used to store the collection of elements in multiple rows and columns.

- **_Multi Dimensional Array_** is used to store the collection of elements in multiple rows.

- **_Multi Dimensional Array_** is used to store the collection of elements in multiple columns.

### Example

```java
int a[][] = new int[2][2];
a[0][0] = 10;
a[0][1] = 20;
a[1][0] = 30;
a[1][1] = 40;
```
